# Working with Twitter

Twitter is an amazing service for connecting people all over the world to talk
about the latest celebrity gossip.

As the [README](../README.md) suggests, you'll be building a command line
application to interact with twitter. Twitters [web
API](glossary.md#web-service-or-web-api)


Because Twitter makes money selling access to their API; every
[request](glossary.md#request) must be [authenticated at the application
level](glossary.md#authentication_contexts). This means you'll need to register
your application with twitter so you can get your api key and secret.

### Registering Your Application

1. Go to [dev.twitter.com](https://dev.twitter.com/) and sign in with your twitter account
2. Go to https://apps.twitter.com/app/new to create a new app (previous instructions no longer match Twitter site)

3. Fill in the Application details section.
  * P.s. Both the `Website` and `Callback URL` fields need a public website address;
    but it doesn't have to be yours. I put http://www.google.com/.
4. Accept the "Rules of the Road"
5. Click "Create Your Application"
6. Click "API Keys"
7. Use `mv .env.example .env` to use [Dotenv](glossary.md#dotenv) to manage your
   secret data and rely on [.gitignore](glossary.md#gitignore) to keep it out of
   your github.
8. Fill in your API Key and API Secret in `.env`


At this point, your application can access twitter and read public information!
Hooray! Now your app can keep up on
[@justinbeiber](https://twitter.com/JustinBieber)!

Let's check out what the Beib has to say, shall we?

### Getting a Users Timeline from the Command Line

Before we go all cahrazy and start programming some ruby, we'll want to try it
from the terminal.

To do this, we'll be using the
[statuses/user\_timeline
API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/statuses/user_timeline).
This page tells us everything about how to get a twitter users timeline from their API. Let's break it down!

* Resource URL - This is the location on the Internet we'll be requesting
  statuses from.
* Parameters - This is a bunch of optional (or required) data the service could
  use.  The only one we need is `screen_name`.
* Example Request - An example of both the URL to use to make the request, and the data returned by it.

Now, let's grab that data!

1. Go back to [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com)
1. Select your application
1. Click on the `Test Oauth` button.
1. Note the `Consumer key` and `Consumer secret` fields already
   have your Applications API Token and API Secret.
1. Fill in `Request URI` with `https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/user_timeline.json`
1. Fill in `Request query` with `screen_name=justinbeiber`
1. Click `See OAuth Signature for this request`

*Phew*! All this work just to get some Beiber tweets! There are two interesting parts of this page:

1. The `Authorization header` - This [HTTP Header](glossary.md#http-headers)
   identifies your application to the Twitter service. This is the literal text
   that is transmitted as part of an [http request](glossary.md#request).
2. The `cURL command` - This is a command you can copy and paste into your
   terminal to see Justin Beibers tweets!

Go ahead! Copy and paste the contents of the `cURL command` into your terminal
and run it!

What's all that text that flies by!? It's tweets
[encoded](glossary.md#encoding-and-decoding) as
[JSON](glossary.md#json-javascropt-object-notation)!

Since JSON is somewhat hard to read, let's use Ruby to parse this down!

### Getting Tweets in Ruby

First, make sure you've followed *all* of the [app registration
instructions](registering-your-application); especially moving `.env.example` to
`.env` and placing your api key and api secret inside of it.

Good? Great! Now, create a file called `scratch.rb` in this projects root
directory, paste the contents into it, and run it!

```
require 'json'
require 'simple_oauth'
require 'excon'
require_relative 'lib/twitter_creds'


authorization_header = SimpleOAuth::Header.new("get",
                                               "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/user_timeline.json",
                                               { :screen_name => "justinbeiber" },
                                               { :consumer_key => API_KEY,
                                                 :consumer_secret => API_SECRET })

response = Excon.send("get", "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/user_timeline.json", {
  :query => { :screen_name => "justinbeiber" },
  :headers => { "Authorization" => authorization_header.to_s }
})

beibs_tweets = JSON.parse(response.body)
puts beibs_tweets.first
```

Well, wouldya look at that?! It's a ruby hash of Justin Beibers latest tweet!
Now, tweets have quite a bit of [Metadata](glossary.md#metadata); so let's
investigate!

```
beibs_tweets.first.keys
# See anything interesting? How bout "text"?
beibs_tweets.first["text"]
```

Congratulations! You've interacted with twitters API! Now pour yourself your
beverage of choice, since we've still got a ways to go if we want to be able to
publish DMs and tweets as ourselves.

### Allow your application to post on your behalf

In order to send tweets for a user, your application needs to act on that users
behalf. This is where the [access token](glossary.md#access-token) and [access
token secret](glossary.md#access-token-secret) come in to play.

When you log in to an application with your facebook, google, or twitter account
it generates an access token and secret for the requesting application; which
the application can then use to act on your behalf.

We're not going to tackle logging in with [OAuth](glossary.md#oauth) right now;
instead we're going to rely on twitter's kindness in that they let us generate
the access token for the owner of an application. So:

1. Visit and log in to [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com)
1. Select your application
1. Click the "Permissions"
1. Select "Read, Write and Access direct messages"
1. Click "Update settings"
1. You *may* need to refresh the page if it doesn't reflect the changes.
1. Click the "API Keys" tab
1. Scroll down to "Your access token"
1. You should see `Access token` and `Access token secret` fields. If not, click
   the `Create my access token` button.
1. You *may* need to refresh the page if it doesn't reflect the changes.
1. You *may* need to verify your phone number of your twitter account if you
   haven't already. Twitter is being more picky.
1. Plug your `access_token` and `access_token_secret` into `.env`

OK! Let's move on!

### Posting a Direct Message via the command line

Twitter has a great HTTP [API for sending direct
messages](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/post/direct_messages/new) to
other users; which is how all those "social media experts" automatically DM
people who follow them.

Let's try to DM ourselves!
1. Click the "Test OAuth" button after you've selected [your
   app](https://apps.twitter.com)
1. Scroll to Request Settings and select `POST`
1. Fill in `Request URI:` with `https://api.twitter.com/1.1/direct_messages/new.json`
1. Fill in `Request query:` with `screen_name=<YOUR TWITTER SCREEN NAME>&text=I
   know kung fu!`
1. Click `See OAuth signature for this request`
1. Copy and paste the `cURL command` into a terminal
1. Check your DMs
1. Gape in awe at your ability to impersonate yourself with a computer program

Woah! We can send DMs! We can also post tweets or perform any action that
requires a [user authentication context](glossary#authentication-contexts)! WE
COULD MAKE A SOCIAL MEDIA APP AND IPO! OH M... Ok. Sorry. I'll calm down now.

How bout we do it in ruby?

### Posting a Direct Message with Ruby
Again, ensure you've [Allowed your application to post on your
behalf](allow-your-applicatoin-to-post-on-your-behalf)

Then copy and paste the following into scratch.rb:

```
require 'json'
require 'simple_oauth'
require 'excon'
require_relative 'lib/twitter_creds'

authorization_header = SimpleOAuth::Header.new("post",
                                               "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/direct_messages/new.json",
                                               { :screen_name => "zspencer",
                                                 :text => "I can send myself DMs in Ruby!" },
                                               { :consumer_key => API_KEY,
                                                 :consumer_secret => API_SECRET,
                                                 :token => ACCESS_TOKEN,
                                                 :token_secret => ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET })

response = Excon.send("post", "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/direct_messages/new.json", {
  :query => { :screen_name => "zspencer",
              :text => "I can send myself DMs in Ruby!" },
  :headers => { "Authorization" => authorization_header.to_s }
})

puts response.body
puts response.status
```

A couple things to notice:

1. You should update the `screen_name` keys in both hashes to be your actual
   screen name.
1. A hash representing the [query variables](glossary.md#query-variables) is
   duplicated in both `Excon.send` and `SimpleOAuth::Header.new`. This is due to
   [how OAuth works](docs/oauth.md#how-it-works), and could be extracted to a
   variable.

But wow! Look at that! We can send API requests in ruby!

We've provided a [more detailed breakdown of the motivation and inner workings
of oauth](docs/oauth.md) for the obsessive learners in the cohort. It may cause
more confusion than it clears up; but if you really want to know...
